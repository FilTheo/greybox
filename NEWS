greybox v0.1.1 (Release data: 2018-03-05)
==============

Changes:
* We now do not depend on smooth. We suggest it. It's smooth that should depend on greybox!
* New function imported from smooth - AICc.
* New functions for the S distribution (the maximisation of likelihood of which corresponds to the minimum of HAM): ds, ps, qs, rs.
* stepwise now returns the object of two classes: greybox and lm.
* combiner now returns three: greybox, lm and greyboxC.
* nParam is moved to greybox from smooth.

Bugfixes:
* If smooth is not installed, plot forecasts using simpler function.
* The forecasts are now produced for the combined models in cases of fat regressions.
