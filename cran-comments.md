## Version
This is the initial release of the package ``greybox``, v0.2.0
This version now includes a more detailed explanation of the package and a more focused title.
I also changed the description as advised by Uwe Ligges, referring to the most relevant source at the moment.
Corrected the doi reference according to Uwe's recommendations. Thanks for the feedback!
